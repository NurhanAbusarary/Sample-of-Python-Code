# Sample-of-Python-Code

This is a sample code of Python. It code is a part of my dissertation titled "Automatic Short Answers Grading System". The aim is to create system that can be used to help human graders (teachers) in the scoring process with crateing a software that can be as close as to what humans do as well as requires the least software and time. The system is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multiple Machine Learning techinques. In this respiratory, there is a sample code of the project.

The directory contains the following files:
* _dataset_: it contains the dataset used to experiment the system before preprocessing it.
* _data_: it contains the data after preprocessing to be used later.
* _utils_: it contains a _utils.py_ file which has the common functions including the NLP functions.
* _Powergrading_Preprocessing.ipynb_: it is used to preprocess the Powergrading dataset.
* _XGBoost_Powergrading.ipynb_: it contains the machine learning algorithm XGBoost, which is one of the algorithms used to design the system.
